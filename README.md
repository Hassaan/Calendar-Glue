Calendar Glue
=============

This is a chrome extension!

It adds events straight into your Google Calendar from Chrome!

Just select any piece of text describing an event in Chrome and from the right-click context menu, choose to parse 
the text using Calendar Glue and watch as the event is magically added into your Google Calendar!

This app was built during [Facebook's University of Waterloo Hackathon 2012](https://www.facebook.com/events/205373126215919/) 
where it won 3rd place.
